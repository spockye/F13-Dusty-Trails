# CONTRIBUTING TO DUSTY TRAILS

**Reporting Issues**

Please use the #bug-reports channel in the Dusty Trails Discord.
If you do not have access to the Discord, Github Issues is okay, but not advised.

**Contributing - Code Quality**

All contributions should be formatted well and follow traditional SS13 code standards as you might find on /tg/.
Failure to maintain code standards will likely result in your PR being reviewed with 'requested changes'.
If the outlined changes are not corrected within 7 days, your PR will likely be closed.
You are welcome to continue your work should this happen, and submit a new PR when it is ready.
Your work will be treated with respect and sincerity as long as you approach it with the same intentions.

**Contributing - Game Quality**

Even the most functional and well-formatted code may not be accepted if it does not improve the game experience.
Will your pull request improve the state of affairs, fix problems, and bring more advantage than disadvantage?
Does it fall in with the general plans for the server, and the content ethos?
In general, the more dramatic your proposed changes are, the more advised it is that you discuss it on the Discord first.
This may also avoid wasted time if someone else is working on similar or overlapping content.

**Contributing - Modularization**

Modularization is the containment of new code. For example, Sunset Wasteland placing all their work in a 'modular-sunset' folder.
There is no requirement here to adhere to strict modularization practices: our code is horrendously outdated and has no direct upstream.
However, the more modular your code is, the more maintainable it tends to be.
Code that is absolutely everywhere when it could be more contained, may meet the criteria for 'requested changes'.

**Resources**

TG has some great resources for aspiring contributors. Keep in mind not all guidance will apply here, but broadly, it fits.
